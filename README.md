# Fiplr - Another "Find in Project"-ler for Emacs

Fiplr—a hopeless mish-mash of "Find in Project" and the suffix "-er"—is an
Emacs package built to make it fast and simple to navigate around deeply
nested large projects. It uses a fuzzy searching algorithm to locate files,
directories and open buffers.

A key design goal is to make Fiplr really easy to use with little-to-no
configuration, beyond a single key binding.

It is heavily inspired by Vim's [ctrlp](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) and
TextMate's Command-T.

I personally work with some large projects, so I'll be sure to make Fiplr
nice and snappy with them, by using sensible caching and efficient data
structures.

Fiplr is a work in progress. Check back soon for updates.
