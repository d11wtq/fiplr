;; Overview:
;;
;; Fiplr makes it really easy to find files anywhere within your entire
;; project. Files and directories are located by typing just a few characters
;; in the order in which they appear in the path, but not necessarily adjacent
;; to one another.
;;
;; For example, if you have a file ./lib/game/leaderboards.rb, you can
;; just run `M-x fiplr-find-file` and type `gldr` (G-ame L-ea-D-e-R-boards)
;; and your file will be listed. Navigate between multiple matches with the
;; left and right arrow keys and select one with the return key.
;;
;; You may add multiple patterns that are order-independent of one another
;; by using the ";" character to separate the patterns. Suppose we had typed
;; just `ldr` in the above example and too many matches come up. Rather than
;; backspace to add part of the directory name and narrow the search down,
;; we can just type `;ga`. Read this like an "and" operator.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; Run `M-x fiplr-find-file` to find files.
;; Run `M-x fiplr-find-directory` to find directories.
;; Run `M-x fiplr-find-buffer` to find open buffers.
;; Run `M-x fiplr-clear-cache` to empty the file cache.
;;
;; Once fiplr is running:
;;
;; Switch between modes with `C-f`, `C-d` and `C-b`.
;; Reset and reload with `C-r`.
;; 
;; For convenience, bind `C-p` to `fiplr-find-file`:
;;
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-p") 'fiplr-find-file)
