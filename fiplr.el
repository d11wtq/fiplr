;; Overview:
;;
;; Fiplr makes it really easy to find files anywhere within your entire
;; project. Files and directories are located by typing just a few characters
;; in the order in which they appear in the path, but not necessarily adjacent
;; to one another.
;;
;; For example, if you have a file ./lib/game/leaderboards.rb, you can
;; just run `M-x fiplr-find-file` and type `gldr` (G-ame L-ea-D-e-R-boards)
;; and your file will be listed. Navigate between multiple matches with the
;; left and right arrow keys and select one with the return key.
;;
;; You may add multiple patterns that are order-independent of one another
;; by using the ";" character to separate the patterns. Suppose we had typed
;; just `ldr` in the above example and too many matches come up. Rather than
;; backspace to add part of the directory name and narrow the search down,
;; we can just type `;ga`. Read this like an "and" operator.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; Run `M-x fiplr-find-file` to find files.
;; Run `M-x fiplr-find-directory` to find directories.
;; Run `M-x fiplr-find-buffer` to find open buffers.
;; Run `M-x fiplr-clear-cache` to empty the file cache.
;;
;; Once fiplr is running:
;;
;; Switch between modes with `C-f`, `C-d` and `C-b`.
;; Reset and reload with `C-r`.
;; 
;; For convenience, bind `C-p` to `fiplr-find-file`:
;;
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-p") 'fiplr-find-file)

;;; --- Package Configuration

;; The default set of files/directories to look for at the root of a project.
(defvar *fiplr-default-root-markers*
  '(".git" ".svn" ".hg" ".bzr"))

;; Settings for project root directories.
(defcustom fiplr-root-markers *fiplr-default-root-markers*
  "A list of files or directories that are found at the root of a project."
  :type    'list
  :group   'fiplr

;;; --- Public Functions

;; Defines fiplr's determination of the project root.
(defun fiplr-root ()

  "The first directory containing one of fiplr-root-markers is the root."
  "If no root marker is found, the current working directory is used."

                 (directory-file-name
                  (file-name-directory (buffer-file-name)))
               (expand-file-name "."))))
    (or (fiplr-find-root cwd fiplr-root-markers)
        cwd)))

;;; --- Private Functions

;; Search algorithm to find dir with .git etc.
(defun fiplr-find-root (path root-markers)
  "Tail-recursive part of project-root."
  (let* ((this-dir (file-name-as-directory path))

;; Predicate looking at path for a root marker.
(defun fiplr-root-p (path root-markers)
  "Predicate to check if the given directory is a project root."
  (let ((dir (file-name-as-directory path)))
    (member-if (lambda (marker)
